## RDRAND based HWRNG for Linux

This project is for playing the with Linux HWRNG API. It implements a HWRNG based on Intel's RDRAND and RDSEED instructions.


##Disclaimer

I am not interested in any debates about the trustworthiness of Intel (or any other OEM), about backdoors, or anything else along those lines. Technical feedback about the implementation or about assumptions underlying the implementation are, of course, welcome.

Also, this project will very likely contain code that is not tested very well, or not tested at all. If you choose to try this code out, you do so *AT YOUR OWN RISK*.
